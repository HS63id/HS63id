   ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is HS63id. Most of my friends call me Stall.
I'm a student who is interested in programming, art, and sport. I also like gaming, especially Minecraft, but I've been lazy lately.
I'm currently learning "web development languages": HTML, CSS, and many more to learn. 
I signed up for github on 21st of March, 2022. I'm looking forward to collaborating with other fellow programmers and what github has to offer.
I mostly use discord to chat with friends, so if you want to reach me, you can add me in discord. My username is HS63#5377.

Thank you for reading my autobiography! Stay safe :D
