    My name is HS63id. Most of my friends call me Stall.
    <br> I'm a student who is interested in programming, art, and sport. I also like gaming, especially Minecraft, but I've been lazy lately.
    <br> I'm currently learning "web development languages": HTML, CSS, and many more to learn. 
    <br> I've tried using a few programming software: Visual Studio Code and Replit. My favourite is Replit. 
    <br> I signed up for github on 21st of March, 2022. I'm looking forward to collaborating with other fellow programmers and what github has to offer.
    <br> I mostly use discord to chat with friends, so if you want to reach me, you can add me in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/@me">discord</a>. My username is HS63#5377.

    <br> Thank you for reading my autobiography! Stay safe :D
